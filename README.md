I don't really know how to say this, but I would like to start a website to evolve the social concepts of being a "writer" and a "reader" to a new level, involving heavy interactivity.  On this site you will be able to post your best stories, and receive instantaneous feedback.  Writers can publish anything from short stories to novellas.  The length of the post defines how long until the writer may post again.  Adding a strategic aspect to posting, as well as a game changer in the art of story telling.  Tell your story in snippets for speed.  Think found footage in the form of twitter posts.  Tell your story in novellas for dramatic effect.  Twists, cliffhangers, droughts or my. Readers will be in the palm of the writers hand, and you will be able to see audience reaction instantaneously.  As an end game writers can mine the results with our enhanced data algorithms to see how their readers picked up on character development, how they reacted to the story line, were the readers engaged, how long did a reader typically read, did they typically finish a post (scrollable only).  All with the mission of making better content for everyone to enjoy. Both on WriteIt and off.
